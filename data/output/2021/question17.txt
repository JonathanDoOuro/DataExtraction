 
 
OUR WORD OF THE YEAR FOR 2019 IS THEY 
 
English lacks a gender-neutral singular pronoun to correspond with singular pronouns like everyone  or someone , and as a consequence they has 
been used for this purpose for over 600 years. Recently though, they has also been 
used to refer to a person 
whose gender identity 
is nonbinary, a sense that is increasingly common in published text, social media, and in daily personal 
interactions between English speakers. There's no doubt that its use is established in the English language, which is why it was added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in September of 2019. Nonbinary they was also prominent in the news in 2019. 
Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (WA) revealed in April that her child is gender-nonconforming and uses they. And 
the American Psychological Association’s blog officially recommended that singular they be preferred in 
professional writing over “he or she” when the reference is 
to a person whose gender is unknown or to a person who 
prefers they.
