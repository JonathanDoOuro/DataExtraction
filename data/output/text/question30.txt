Redoma de Vidro), da escritora estadunidense Sylvia Plath.  
 
“From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful 
future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a 
happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet 
and another fig was a brilliant professor, (…) and beyond and 
above these f igs were many more figs I couldn't quite make 
out. (…) I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to 
decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by 
one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”
