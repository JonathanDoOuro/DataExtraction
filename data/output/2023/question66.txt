But if you happen to be a man sometime in the future, and 
you’ve made it this far, please remember you will never be sub -
ject to the temptation or feeling you must forgive, a man, as 
a woman. But remember that forgiveness too is a power. To 
beg for it is a power, and to withhold or bestow it is a power, 
perhaps the greatest. Maybe none of this is about control. May -
be it isn’t really about who can own whom, who can do what 
to whom and get away with it, even as far as death. Maybe it 
isn’t about who can sit and who has to kneel or stand or lie 
down (…). Maybe it’s about who can do what to whom and 
be forgiven for it. Never tell me it amounts to the same thing.
